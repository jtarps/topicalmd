If the total score is below the publish threshold and issues are fixable, make corrections directly in the markdown. Do not rewrite the entire article — make targeted fixes only.

CRITICAL: If the article ends abruptly, is missing its conclusion, or trails off mid-section, you MUST add a proper concluding section that summarizes key takeaways and gives readers a clear next step. An incomplete article should never be published.
